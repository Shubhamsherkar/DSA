--- Arrays :An array is a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type. Each element in the array is identified by its index, which represents its position in the array. Arrays are commonly used to store and manipulate collections of data. In most programming languages, arrays have a fixed size, meaning that the number of elements they can hold is predetermined during their creation. Arrays can be one-dimensional, two-dimensional (matrices), or multidimensional (arrays of arrays).

-- Pointers :
- 1. Two Pointers:
The two-pointer technique involves using two pointers to iterate through an array or list, usually from different ends or at different speeds. This technique is often used for tasks like finding pairs that satisfy a certain condition, checking for symmetry or palindromes, or finding subarrays with a specific sum.
- 2.Fast and Slow Pointers:
The fast and slow pointer technique involves using two pointers that move at different speeds to traverse a linked list or array. This technique is often used for tasks like detecting cycles in linked lists, finding the middle element, or partitioning elements based on a specific condition.

-- Sliding window :The sliding window technique is a common algorithmic pattern used for efficiently processing arrays or lists. It involves maintaining a "window" (subarray or sublist) of elements as you iterate through the array or list. The window usually starts at the beginning or end of the array and moves or "slides" through the elements by incrementing or decrementing its boundaries.
The sliding window technique is particularly useful for solving problems that involve finding subarrays or subsequences that satisfy specific conditions, such as the maximum sum, longest substring, or minimum window substring problems.
