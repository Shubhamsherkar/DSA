### Stack and Queue

- Stack:
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. It operates on two main operations:
* Basic Operations on Stack

- push() to insert an element into the stack
- pop() to remove an element from the stack
- top() Returns the top element of the stack.
- isEmpty() returns true if stack is empty else false.
- size() returns the size of stack.

- Queue:
A queue is also a linear data structure, but it follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. It operates on two main operations:
* Basic Operations on Queue

- enqueue(item): Adds an element to the back of the queue.
- dequeue(): Removes the front element from the queue and returns it.
- peek(): Returns the front element of the queue without removing it.
- isEmpty(): Returns true if the queue is empty; otherwise, returns false.
- size(): Returns the number of elements currently in the queue.
